# Simple Recorder.js demo
A simple HTML5/JS demo that uses [Recorder.js](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs) to record audio as wav and pause/resume the recording process.

The demo works on both mobile - including Safari 11 - and desktop browsers. I've taken great care to make the demo easy to use on both screens.
